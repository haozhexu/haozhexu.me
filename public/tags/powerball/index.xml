      <description>A Concise Method of Lottery Prediction  Q: The balls are randomly picked, how could you predict?
A: If so, why don&amp;rsquo;t people usually buy number combinations like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?
Q: That does not look random at all!
 In fact, the chance that the next lottery winning numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, is exactly the same as every other combination of numbers, but still, people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t usually buy number combinations which look like following certain pattern, and this is precisely how the algorithm works for prediting future winning numbers.</description>
