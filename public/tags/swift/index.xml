      <description>Swift Study Notes The source of this file is available on Github where you can find the XCode playground file.
The generated markdown is currently used as a Hugo generated content hosted on my website haozhexu.me for better readability.
This is the playground I used during learning Swift, I mainly read The Swift Programming Language from Apple, took notes and wrote code as I read.
Soon I realised the notes could be organized in a way so that a human readable markdown could be generated with some tweaks, and I can even use Hugo to generate an HTML from it and host it somewhere.</description>
