# Rediscover the Wonderful World with Metaphysics

## The Moon (1)

> How rare the moon, so round and clear!  
> With cup in hand, I ask of the blue sky,  
> "I do not know in the celestial sphere  
> What name this festive night goes by?"  
> Su Shi, Chinese Poem

I once had a long dream, in the dream I was invited to a meeting and the meeting took place inside the Pyramid. The meeting was called The Pharaoh meeting. In real life, I also have meetings from time to time, if a meeting takes half of a day, there is usually a few breaks in the middle and the organizer would provide refreshers in order to make it not boring. During the meeting in my dream, there was also some rest time in the middle, when I could chat with other people. According to Freud, my dream should be a reflection of reality: work can be boring, so the meeting place was inside a closed space, but why was it the Pyramid? Perhaps I was collecting information about the Pyramid at that time - thus the statement that "dream is a reflection of reality" seems to make sense.

> I sat thinking how terribly sad it was that people are made in such a way that they get used to something as incredible as living. One day we suddenly take the fact that we exist for granted - and then, yes, then we don’t think about it anymore until we are about to leave the world again.

> Jostein Gaarder, The Solitaire Mystery

Freud is a great person, he saw many things that empirical science has not realised. In Jostein Gaarder's book "Sophie's World", most people live on the surface of a giant rabbit's skin and drill down for material interests; In the evening, moon starts to shine, while people enjoy its light, they never ask where the light is from, and put this unsolved mystery aside because the source of light does not matter to them in pursuing material interests down the rabbit's skin. Freud accidentally lifted his head, saw the starry sky and the bright moon, the light of the moon and star pierced into his eyes, made him discover that the mysterious light actually comes from upper sky, so he realized the world is merely a giant rabbit and there is a much broader universe outside. The fact he discovered is closer to the truth; yet what he saw was still an enigma, because "God said, Let there be light: and there was light".

Whether it is in the ancient Eastern culture dominated by metaphysics, the ancient Western culture dominated by theology, or the modern age of science and technology, the moon always has been full of mystery. In the oriental culture, there was "Chang Er Flies to the Moon", Wu Gang and the Jade Rabbit living on the Moon Palace, and the ancients derived a complete calendar according to the lunar trajectory; In western cultures, there are mysterious religion and stories about vampire and werewolves that are often used as sci-fi material in films, even the opening of the movie "Transformers" suggests that the Transformers are hiding on the back of the moon. **It seems that cultures and history around the world all have revealed either explicitly or implicitly that human and the moon have been inextricably linked.**

How was the moon formed? There are quite a few hypotheses about its origin:

- **Fission**: an ancient, rapidly spinning Earth expelled a piece of its mass, and it was proposed that the Pacific Ocean represented the scar of [this event][1]. Today it is known that the oceanic crust that makes up this ocean basin is relatively young, about 200 million years old or less, whereas the Moon is much older. The Moon does not consist of oceanic crust but of mantle material, which originated inside the proto-Earth in the [Precambrian][2].
- **Accretion**: this hypothesis suggests that the Earth and the Moon formed together as a double system from the primordial accretion disk of the [Solar System][3] The problem with this hypothesis is that it does not explain the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system or why the Moon has a relatively small iron core compared to the Earth (25% of its radius compared to 50% for the Earth)[4]
- **Capture**: This hypothesis states that the Moon was captured by the Earth. One problem is understanding the [capture mechanism][3], a close encounter with Earth typically results in either collision or altered trajectories. For this hypothesis to function, there might have been a large atmosphere around the primitive Earth, which would slow the movement of the Moon by natural aerobraking before it could escape. This hypothesis also has difficulty explaining the essentially [identical oxygen isotope ratios][5] of the two bodies. Furthermore, it's difficult to understand why the Moon was not captured by other bodies which has much greater abstraction than Earth.
- **Impact**: A large planetesimal hits Earth, ejecting material which forms the Moon. This theory could explain ["why the rocks Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon closely resembled rocks on Earth"][6], however, there are also [challenges][3] to this theory: to get material past the Earth's Roche limit, the impactor needs more angular momentum than is now in the Earth-Moon system; And why is there just one moon?

Although there's no defnite conclusion for the origin of the Moon, **scientists agreed that the origin of the moon must have been messier and more complicated than anyone had assumed**, and the reason why I think Freud has his own limitation, was that my dream has a bit more than just a "reflection of reality": in the middle of the Pharaoh meeting there was a short break, and when I chatted to a group of people, someone told me that the Moon was a giant aerocraft that was made by prehistorical human generations, it has an empty core, where Pharaoh's body was stored.

One thing worth noting, there is one prerequisite for all the theories proposed by scientists: the Moon was naturally formed. NASA mentioned that ["any theory which explains the existence of the Moon must naturally explain the following facts"][7]:

- the Moon does not have a substantial iron core like the Earth does
- the lack of volatile substances (e.g. water) in moon rocks implies extra "baking" of the lunar surface relative to that of Earth
- the identical relative abundance of oxygen isotopes on Earth and Moon suggests that the Moon and the Earth were formed at the same distance from the Sun

Apart from above, the Moon has quite a few coincidences:

- The Moon _happens to be_ about 400 times smaller than the Sun, but the Sun _happens to be_ about 400 times further from the Earth than the Moon is. As a result, the apparent disk of the Moon is almost exactly the size of the apparent disk of the Sun.
- Only one side of the Moon is visible from Earth because the Moon _happens to_ rotate on its axis at the same rate that the Moon obits the Earth, this has been persisted for millions of years.
- The orbits of most natural satelistes are roughly elliptical, whereas the orbit of the Moon _happens to be_ a perfect circle.
- The Sun (and many other celestial bodies) has much greater attraction to the Moon, but the Moon stays as the Earth's satelite.
- The diameter of most natural satelites do not exceed 5% of that of their mother planet, but the diameter of the Moon _happens to be_ 27% of that of the Earth.

Although this book is about metaphysics (or pseudo-science), even scientists have found too many coincidences about the Moon.

> There is no astronomical reason why the moon and the sun should fit so well. It is the sheerest of coincidences, and only the Earth among all the planets is blessed in this fashion.
>
> -- Isaac Asimov

> ...is it also coincidence that the moon is at just the right distance from the earth to completely cover the sun during an eclipse? While the diameter of the moon is a mere 2160 miles against the sun's gigantic 864'000 miles, it is nevertheless in just the proper position to block out all but the sun's flaming corona when it moves between the sun and the earth.

Compared to existing theories of the Moon's origin, my theory - or the dream theory sounds more reasonable: the Moon wasn't formed naturally, it was made by human from pre-history generation. This theory could explain all the facts: no iron core because it was designed to be a giant spaceship; Extra "baking" of lunar surface might be some special treatment of material, like the material we nowadays make aircraft; Since it was made in parts and later assembled together, its oxygen isotopes is identical to that of the Earth (ie. same distance from the Sun). It also explains all the coincidences mentioned earlier: there's no coincidence at all because it was human made.

In next chapter I'll briefly talk about some evidence of the co-existence of pre-historic generation and current human civilisation, and let's revisit the quote from the movie "2012":

> Just like this cup of water, you are filled with thoughts and prejudices. If you want to see the real wisdom, you must first empty your cup before adding more.
