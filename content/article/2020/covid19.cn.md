自19年底开始的新型冠状病毒到现在已经在全球各地造成了各种恐慌，一些地方的商业几乎已经停滞，导致了激增的失业率，我们目前并没有一种特效药或疫苗，可怕的是我们并不知道这种情况将会持续多久。事实上，病毒造成的疾病在人类历史上并不少见，中国古代人们通过五运六气的气象、环境系统来预测病毒和对症治疗，我们是否能从中有所借鉴？这篇文章便是基于此的分析，为了了解这一系统，我们先要重新认识一下在大多数人眼里也许是稀疏平常的概念：时间。

我们看看维基百科上是如何解释时间的：

> A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by change in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked.  
> （一年是地球绕太阳公转的轨道周期。由于地球的轴向倾斜，一年的过程会经历季节的变化，其特征是天气，日照时间的变化以及植被和土壤的肥力。在地球周围的温带和亚极地区，通常公认四个季节：春季，夏季，秋季和冬季。在热带和亚热带地区，几个地理区域没有规定的季节。但是在季节性热带地区，可以识别和跟踪每年的湿季和干季。）  
> -- 维基百科

如果只从上面的描述来看，时间的概念对我们来说并不陌生，然而，了解中国古代的时间历法系统的人并不在多数，包括中国人自己。这套系统被用来指导人类日常生活，从天气到个人生活，从农业到政权更替。该系统的基础是五行学说和天干地支的循环，这两个概念也是本文研究病毒的关键。

## 五行学说

五行学说由金、木、水、火、土这五个抽象概念组成，它们是古代中国人眼里物质世界的基本元素，类似于我们在学校中学到的元素周期表。五行与元素周期表有一个共同特性：转化。化学反应的转化包括分子破裂成原子，原子重新排列组合成新的分子，而五行的五种元素也存在着相生与相克的转化：

相生：

- 木生火
- 火生土
- 土生金
- 金生水
- 水生木

相克：

- 木克土
- 土克水
- 水克火
- 火克金
- 金克木

下图直观的表达了五行生克的规律：

TODO: 示意图

以上生克的规律是基于古人对自己生存的客观环境的认知。举例来说，一场雨后，土壤吸收了雨水，雨过天晴，植物生长，这一过程就包含了土克水以及水生木；再举一例，麦田里起了火，我们用水来灭火，以免麦子被烧成灰烬，这里就包含了水克火以及火生土的概念。当然，具体情况里每种元素的分量也很重要，比如我们试图用一小杯水去浇灭一场大火，不光没有效果，可能还会加剧火势，五行里这属于不足而被反噬，如果用化学的角度来解释，我们知道，每个水分子都有一个氧原子和两个氢原子，在火很大而水很少的情况下，就有可能分裂重组成氢气和氧气，这两种都属于易燃气体，反倒有助于火势。

TODO: 五行与器官

因为五行学说具有的相生与相克规律，它也被用来描述许多事物内在的关系，从宇宙天体到人体器官，从政权交替到医药病理。而这些事物当中，并不是每个事物都独立存在，比如天气和人体器官，各自有独立的基于五行的归纳，而这两者（天气、人体）又可以互相联系，形成一套描述气候变化规律与人体相互作用的理论。有人可能会问，四季变化对人类来说不是什么新的东西，我们都知道，在有四季的地区，夏天热，冬天冷，秋天凉爽（当然不同的地理位置会有差别），那么五行学说又能提供什么新的东西呢？好吧，你是否注意到，即便在同一个地区，有些年的冬天比其他年更冷（或更热）？有些年的夏季温度会提早来，有些时候会晚到？有时候夏天雨水少，而有时候雨水多，到了一定的极端则会引发干旱或洪涝？事实上，即便是在四季分明的地方，每一年都有自己细微的特征，而这些特征并不能简单的用四季来概括。古时候人们用五行、阴阳学说为基础，总结归纳了一套与时间历法相对应的，方便人们参考气象、疾病的系统：天干地支与五运六气。

## 天干地支

维基百科是这样描述天干地支的：

> 干支是天干与地支的合称，由两者经一定的组合方式搭配成六十对，为一个周期，循环往复，称为六十甲子或六十花甲。  
> 古代中国用以记录年、月、日、时。日本、朝鲜、越南、琉球等汉字文化圈地区也曾跟随古代中国，使用干支来记录时间。

顾名思义，天干地支包括十天干和十二地支。十天干有十个符号，每个符号对应一个五行元素。注意，天干的延续，所对应的五行元素也是按照相生的顺序来的。

| 天干 | 发音 | 五行 |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 甲 | jiǎ | 木 |
| 乙 | yǐ | 木 |
| 丙 | bǐng | 火 |
| 丁 | dīng | 火 |
| 戊 | wù | 土 |
| 己 | jǐ | 土 |
| 庚 | gēng | 金 |
| 辛 | xīn | 金 |
| 壬 | rén | 水 |
| 癸 | guǐ | 水 |

十二地支是一个直到现在还在东南亚许多地区使用的序列系统，比如星象和十二生肖，它建立与木星轨道分割成的十二个部分。

| 地支 | 发音 | 生肖 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 子 | zǐ | 鼠 |
| 丑 | chǒu | 牛 |
| 寅 | yín | 虎 |
| 卯 | mǎo | 兔 |
| 辰 | chén | 龙 |
| 巳 | sì | 蛇 |
| 午 | wǔ | 马 |
| 未 | wèi | 羊 |
| 申 | shēn | 猴 |
| 酉 | yǒu | 鸡 |
| 戌 | xū | 狗 |
| 亥 | hài | 猪 |

天干和地支的组合方式，是第一个天干和第一个地支并列为甲子，第二个天干和第二个地支并列为乙丑，一只延续循环，直到并列的天干地支为癸亥，之后再从甲子开始。每一个并列组合对应一年。

### Stages and Ways

Just like we have "season" which divides a year into four climatic categories, on top of sexagenary cycle (ie. ancient concept of "year"), there is also a complex system that divides a year into different stages, in different ways (elemental and climatic):

1. (elemental) Each year in sexagenary cycle has an _element of the year_ which is from the Five Elements, for example, the year 2020 (G1) is mostly Metal.
2. (elemental) Within every year there are five __elemental stages__, each corresponds to an element, in the order of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water, this is a five season pattern which is very similar to our "four seasons": Spring (warm) - Wood, Summer (hot/dry) - Fire, Summer (wet) - Earth, Autumn (cool) - Metal, Winter (cold) - Water.
3. (climatic) On top of __elemental stages__, each year also has six __primary climatic stages__: wind, fire, heat, moisture, dryness and cold. (note, "fire" and "heat" may sound overlapping but they represent two differing manifestations, with "fire" being an internal process and "heat" being an external influence)
4. (climatic) Besides __primary climatic stages__ that repeats and stays the same every year (like the four seasons), throughout a year there is also the __secondary climatic influence__, it varies from year to year, it is a more detailed climatic feature, it can explain why some years have colder winters, some years have hotter summer, in some years winter comes ealier or later, etc.

The full system is way more complex than the four points above, I won't go into the details, but just need to explain a bit more on the elemental stages and influences because it's directly related to our topic - the virus. The ancients believed that changes in nature, such as plant growth, flowering, fruiting, migratory birds, snow, thunder, river freezing, etc, all reflect the process of the transformation of Five Elements, which then manifest in reality one or several climatic characteristics (wind, fire, heat, moisture, dryness and cold) that would influence human body, these characteristics are often called as "six climatic influence". Modern science also agrees that weather or climate can influence human body which more or less aligns with the traditional thinking that the atmosphere can have more health effects. For us to understand, we only need to know that both modern and traditional thinking believes that extreme weather or climate can do harm (ie. influence human body): if the climate is normal, the "six influences" in human body is also balanced; When the climate is abnormal, the balance in the body is also disordered. Using the pattern of "six influences" in each sexagenary year, and how they appear at different times within a particular year, we can infer the occurrence of diseases and take preventive measures early. Furthermore, the unbalance of the "six climatic influences" can affect the incidence of diseases and the prognosis of transmission, due to the disease is biased to a certain pathogenesis in the year, such as more moisture/wetness, so that certain types of diseases have a higher chance of onset. If we have fully understanding of the pattern, we should be able to figure out drugs that get better results. The book Advanced Textbook of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Pharmacology (1) states:

> Wind, cold, summer-heat, damp, dryness, and fire are the six climatic factors which correspond to normal seasonal changes. Normally, they are known as the “six qi”. The growth of all living things depends on the existence of the six qi. They should not be harmful, rather, they should be helpful to human beings. Human beings have learned the laws of nature through the changing features of the seasons and have adapted themselves to these changes. Thus, the six qi normally will not cause diseases. However, if and when the six qi become abnormal or excessive, as happens in abrupt changes in environmental conditions, and if the body’s resistance is too weak to adapt to these variations, the six qi may become the six excesses: pathogenic factors that cause diseases. Because the six excesses are abnormal qi, they are known as the six unhealthy qi, or the six exogenous pathogenic factors.

In other words, if we can figure out which climatic factor or factors have supportive effect on Covid-19 virus, we can probably get some clue for curing the virus from the opposite of that factor.

## A Possible Cure

Let's start by first examing some of the well-known diseases in human history, from the perspective of all we discussed before.

__Georgian Calendar__

| Disease | Start | End |
| ------- | ----- | --- | 
| SARS    | Late 2002 | Mid 2003 |

__Sexagenary__

| Desease | Start | End | Start Element | Climatic Influence |
| ------- | ----- | --- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| SARS |  I7 (壬午) | J8 (癸未) |  WATER  | (heavy) Moisture, Earth  |
| 



According to the Fact Sheet from Centers of Disease Control and Prevention of US, "SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003", its symptoms include high fever, headache, body aches and an overall feeling of discomfort. Converting 2003 Georgian to Sexagenary Cycle we get J8 (癸未年), whose element is Water, and 





Ancient Chinese also found five flavours of food each have their own characterstics and function (I gave each of them an abbreviation, to use in the calculation later):

- Sour (SUR)
- Sweet (SWT)
- Bitter (BTR)
- Spicy (SPC)
- Salt (SLT)

Each of the flavours could benefit an organ while has disadvantage for another organ, if you ever went to any Asian (mostly Chinese) massage business, you might have seen this picture:



It illustrates the relations between human organs in term of Five Elements:

| Organ | Element | Good for the Organ | Bad for the Organ |
| ------| ------- | ------------------:| -----------------:|
| Kidney | Water | Salt | Sweet |
| Lung | Metal | Spicy | Bitter |
| Spleen | Earth | Sweet | Sour |
| Heart | Fire | Bitter | Salt |
| Liver | Wood | Sour | Spicy |

How does it work? For example, we believe that children would get bad teeth if they eat lots of sweets without properly clean their teeth, due to sugar attracts bacteria and lowers mouth’s pH scale (a measure of how acidic a solution is), when the pH of plaque drops below normal, the acidity would start to dissolve minerals and destroy the tooth’s enamel. However, the theory of Chinese medication is that, even if the kid properly cleans the teeth after eating sweets, he/she could still get bad teeth. Based on the picture above showing the relation of Five Elements and internal organs, sweet benefits spleen, which is “Earth”, and “Earth” overcomes “Water” which is the attribute of “Kidney”, and Chinese medication believes teeth (as well as nails, hair) are grown as a result of the “Qi” from kidney (I’ll explain later what Qi is). It’s not a surprise that western scientists also realised the connection between kidney and oral health, such like a study in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology reported that people with kidney disease and those on dialysis are more likely to have periodontal disease and other oral health problems than the general population.

Sounds complex? Not really, you only need to understand the concept of Five Elements and their relation with Five Flavours and internal organs, to figure out what could possibly be the problem when one feels sick. And remember that in order to have good health one should maintain a balance in term of Five Elements within our body. Even under the rule of western life science, we also strive for balance - balance of various types of vitamins that body need, through different types of vegetal, diary products, meat, fish, etc, and we all know that lack of diversity in food consumption could lead to different types of illness.

Easy? Not quite, because there are other factors apart from human body itself, that could lead to human body unbalanced in term of Five Elements, so now let’s look at the Sexagenary Cycle.

2019年末开始的新型冠状病毒发展至今，已经在世界范围内造成了各种恶劣的影响。西方的科学家、医学家正在努力的研究解药，然而在解药研制出来之前，每天都有新增的疑似、确诊感染病例和死亡，而根据已有的科学分析报告来看，病毒有变异、扩散等愈演愈烈的趋势。本文从科学以外的几个方面分析次病毒，最后提出一种寻常人都可以采取的预防措施。

不少人知道，明朝的灭亡源于政治腐败和当权者的无能，但少有人知的是，明朝末年发生了一场瘟疫，到崇祯十六年疫情尤为严重；根据历史资料记载，明朝的灭亡，有相当一部分原因是这场让大部分士兵失去战斗力的瘟疫。

《崇祯实录》记载：“京师大疫，死亡日以万计。”

锦衣卫骆养性回忆：

"昨年京师瘟疫大作 , 死亡枕藉 ,十室九空 , 甚至户丁尽绝 , 无人收敛者。"

在通州:

“崇祯十六年癸未七月大疫，名曰疙疽病，比屋传染，有阖家丧亡竟无收敛者”。
