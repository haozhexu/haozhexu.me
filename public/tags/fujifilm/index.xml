      <description>Best Fuji Lens for Street Photography - 24mm F8 Body Cap Review Human are always contradictory: we say we&#39;d like to save the environment, while we generate lots of waste each day; We say we&#39;d like to be healthy, while living in a unhealthy way of eating and working; We say we&#39;d like to have a young heart, while becoming more and more realistic in a materialistic worldâ€¦even when I escaped to the lonely island of street photography, there is also a contradiction: photographers say street photography is all about content while arguing about the image quality of gears.</description>

      <description>(3) Slow City, Flying Life  Time doesn&#39;t fly, life does.
 When we arrived at Adelaide city, it&#39;s almost dark. We lived in a hotel opposite to the University of Adelaide. It&#39;s not far from CBD, on the back there&#39;s a street full of retailers.
I went out to the street with X-Pro2 and 35mm f2 lens, I&#39;ve read people saying 50mm equivalent focal length is too narrow for today&#39;s street, I think the key is to keep in mind what your lens could see, and look for things that can be framed, regardless of whether the street is narrow or wide.</description>

      <description>(2) Street on Island Kangaroo Island Kangaroo Island isn&#39;t far from Adelaide, famous for its large number of scenery - actually I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s famous or not, the only reason I said so, is because there wasn&#39;t any ferry ticket available several weeks before we travel, so we had no choice but had to go with a tourist group. I guess they bought lots of tickets long time ago, in order to take their customers onto the island.</description>

      <description>In my mind there are three types of travel, the first type is to travel with tourist group, visiting routine places and stay at each place for enough time to take photos (mostly selfies); The second type is more casual and relax, you have your own plan of where to visit and stay, how much time to be spent at each place; The last type isn&#39;t just physically going to somewhere, it&#39;s more about how one&#39;s spirit evolve, like reading a book.</description>
