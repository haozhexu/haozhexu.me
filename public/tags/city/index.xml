      <description>(3) Slow City, Flying Life  Time doesn&#39;t fly, life does.
 When we arrived at Adelaide city, it&#39;s almost dark. We lived in a hotel opposite to the University of Adelaide. It&#39;s not far from CBD, on the back there&#39;s a street full of retailers.
I went out to the street with X-Pro2 and 35mm f2 lens, I&#39;ve read people saying 50mm equivalent focal length is too narrow for today&#39;s street, I think the key is to keep in mind what your lens could see, and look for things that can be framed, regardless of whether the street is narrow or wide.</description>
