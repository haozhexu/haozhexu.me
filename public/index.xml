      <description>Rediscover the Wonderful World with Pseudo-Science Prologue I was on the flight back to China, the air conditioner made me feel sick, it was a bit too cold. I tried to focus on something that could distract me from the sickness, then I noticed the small round window next to me, it reminded me of the windows in the classroom of my elementary school — they have wooden frames painted in green and are always clean.</description>

      <description>Photo taken by a colleague at lunch time, I was using a piece of tissue to cover my face since I’m a shy guy who never wants to be in photos. Until I looked at the photo I didn’t realise that I wasn’t even in focus. Lesson learned from this: one’s not as important as he/she thought in other people’s eyes.
My name is Haozhe XU and I’m an iOS software developer currently based in Melbourne, Australia.</description>
