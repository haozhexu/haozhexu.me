Since the end of 2019, the new coronavirus has caused panic around the world. The number of infections and deaths has been on the rise. The economies of various countries have suffered huge blows, and we currently do not have a specific medicine or vaccine, not to mention the currently known virus mutations cast a shadow over vaccine development based on gene sequence. In fact, viruses have always coexisted with humans on the earth. Before the beginning of modern virology, outside the field of virology, in the history of different cultures, people have their own methods to fight against diseases. Is there some knowledge that we can learn from and get inspiration for the purpose of treating virus?

It brings to my attention that ancient China had a system that were used to predict virus caused by pathegenic climate change, based on which ancient Chinese has built up theory of how a person can improve his/her body system to prevent virus invation. To understand the system, it's necessary to first understand how the ancient Chinese measure time.

Let's have a look at how we measure time in the modern age:

> A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by change in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked.
> -- Wikipedia

The idea of "time" isn't unfamiliar to us if we look at the description above, however, not many people (including Chinese nowadays) know that ancient Chinese had a time system which was used as a guidence for human activities, from weather prediction to individual's wellbeing, from agriculture to the change of regime. The foundation of this system is the Five Elements Theory and the Stems and Branches Cycle, these two concepts are the keys to study the virus in the ancient way.

## Five Elements Theory

The system of Five Elements consists of five conceptual scheme: Fire, Water, Wood, Metal and Earth, they are the fundamental elements of the material world that ancient Chinese believed, similar to the elemental periodic table we learnt in school.

The common nature of chemical elements and the Five Elements is that they all have certain ways of transformation: chemical reactions encompass changes that involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, whereas the Five Elements form a “mutual generating” cycle and a "mutual overcoming" cycle:

| Element | Generate | Overcome |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Metal   | Water    | Wood     |
| Wood    | Fire     | Earth    |
| Water   | Wood     | Fire     |
| Fire    | Earth    | Metal    |
| Earth   | Metal    | Water    |

_(table 1)_

The diagram below gives you a more intuitive view:

TODO: diagram

The transformation above is based on the people's observation of the world. For example, let's imagine such a scene: after a rain the soil absorbs all the rain water, when the sun comes out the plants start to grow, this phenomenon implies Earth overcomes Water as well as Water generates Wood; Yet another example: we use water to put out a fire while the fire burns all the crops into ashes, this phenomenon implies Water overcomes Fire and Fire generates Earth. Of course the quantity of each element also plays an important role, suppose we try to put out a big bushfire with a bowl of water, it won't work and probably will make it even worse. From a chemical perspective we could explain this as each of the water molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, when put on fire, they split and form separate hydrogen and oxygen, both would aggravate the fire.

Due to the abstraction of the Five Elements, it is also used to describe interactions and relations of a wide range of phenomena. For example, internal organs, you may have seen the graph below in Asian massage businesses:

TODO: Five elements and organs

In term of climate, the Five Elements Theory could provide guidence of weather and climate change, to a level of detail that can be used to determine how the environment could influence the health of human.

We know for ages that there are four seasons in many places on the planet: summer is hot, winter is cold and autumn is cool, what other details can Five Elements Theory provide? Well, have you ever noticed that winter in some years are colder than the winter in other years? Summer comes earlier in certain years but later in other years? Sometimes summer has less rain which leads to drought but sometimes it can have quite a lot of water that leads to flood? In fact, the climate of each year is unique in many ways that cannot be simply described by four seasons, ancient Chinese has a system that uses the Five Element Theory extensively to describe the sublte difference of each year, this system co-exists with the ancient calendar: The Sexagenary Cycle.

## The Sexagenary Cycle

Wikipedia has a good explanation of Sexagenary Cycle:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagenary_cycle

which states:

> The sexagenary cycle, also known as the Stems-and-Branches or ganzhi, is a cycle of sixty terms, each corresponding to one year, thus a total of sixty years for one cycle, historically used for reckoning time in China and the rest of the East Asian cultural sphere.

The Sexagenary Cycle is made up by two sets of symboles: the Ten Heavenly Stems and the Twelve Earthly Branches.

### Ten Heavenly Stems

The ten Heavenly Stems are a Chinese system of ordinals, each stem has a corresponding element from the Five Elements. The first column contains the letter replacements for stems, so Western readers who cannot read Chinese could just think of it as a sequence of symbols(letters). Pay attention to the sequence of each stem's element, and how they form a generation-chain: wood -> fire -> earth -> metal -> water (refer to the diagram we mentioned before):

| No. | Heavenly Stem | Mandarin | Five Elements |
| --- | ------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| A | 甲 | jiǎ | Wood |
| B | 乙 | yǐ | Wood |
| C | 丙 | bǐng | Fire |
| D | 丁 | dīng | Fire |
| E | 戊 | wù | Earth |
| F | 己 | jǐ | Earth |
| G | 庚 | gēng | Metal |
| H | 辛 | xīn | Metal |
| I | 壬 | rén | Water |
| J | 癸 | guǐ | Water |

_(table 2)_

### Twelve Earthly Branches

The twelve Earthly Branches form an ordering system used throughout East Asian (even now) in various context, for example, astrological traditions and animal zodiac. It was built upon the orbit of Jupiter, whose celestial circle was divided into 12 sections.

| No. | Earthly Branch | Mandarin | Chinese zodiac |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 子 | zǐ | Rat |
| 2 | 丑 | chǒu | Ox |
| 3 | 寅 | yín | Tiger |
| 4 | 卯 | mǎo | Rabbit |
| 5 | 辰 | chén | Dragon |
| 6 | 巳 | sì | Snake |
| 7 | 午 | wǔ | Horse |
| 8 | 未 | wèi | Goat |
| 9 | 申 | shēn | Monkey |
| 10 | 酉 | yǒu | Rooster |
| 11 | 戌 | xū | Dog |
| 12 | 亥 | hài | Pig |

_(table 3)_

How do Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches work together? The first term jiǎzǐ (甲子 or A1) combines the first heavenly stem with the first earthly branch. The second term yǐchǒu (乙丑 or B2) combines the second stem with the second branch. This pattern continues until both cycles conclude simultaneously with guǐhài (癸亥 or J12), after which it begins again at jiǎzǐ (A1). Each combination resembles a year.

### Ancient Seasons

Just like we have "season" which divides a year into four climatic categories, on top of sexagenary cycle (ie. ancient concept of "year"), there is also a complex system that divides a year into different stages, in different ways (elemental and climatic):

1. __primary element__: each year in sexagenary cycle has a _primary element_ from the Five Elements, e.g. the primary element of the year 2020 (G1) is Metal.
2. __elemental stage__: within every year there are five _elemental stages_, in the order of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water, for the sake of understanding, this can be considered as an analog of the four seasons: spring (warm) - wood, summer (hot/dry) - fire, summer (wet) - earth, autumn (cool) - metal, winter (cold) - water.
3. __primary climatic stage__: on top of _elemental stages_, each year has six _primary climatic stages_ in the order of wind, fire, heat, moisture, dryness and cold. They stay the same every year, a bit like something runs in parallel with the seasons and _elemental stages_: spring - wood - wind, summar - earth - fire/heat/moisture, autumn - metal - dryness, winter - water - cold.
4. __secondary climatic influence__: also consists of wind, fire, heat, moisture, dryness and cold, just like the _primary climatic stage_ above, but the _climatic influence_ varies from year to year. This is a more detailed climatic feature, it can explain why some years have colder winters, some years have hotter summer, in some years winter comes ealier or later, etc.

The full system is way more complex than the four points above, I won't go into the details, but just need to explain a bit more on the elemental stages and influences because it's directly related to our topic - the virus. The ancients believed that changes in nature, such as plant growth, flowering, fruiting, migratory birds, snow, thunder, river freezing, etc, all reflect the process of the transformation of Five Elements, which then manifest in reality one or several climatic characteristics (wind, fire, heat, moisture, dryness and cold) that would influence human body, these characteristics are often called as "six climatic influence". Modern science also agrees that weather or climate can influence human body which more or less aligns with the traditional thinking that the atmosphere can have health effects. For us to understand, we only need to know that both modern and traditional thinking believes that extreme weather or climate can do harm (ie. influence human body): if the climate is normal, the "six influences" in human body is also balanced; When the climate is abnormal, the balance in the body is also disordered.

Using the pattern of "six influences" in each sexagenary year, and how they appear at different times within a year, we can infer the occurrence of diseases and take preventive measures early. Furthermore, the unbalance of the "six climatic influences" can affect the incidence of diseases and the prognosis of transmission, due to the disease is biased to a certain pathogenesis in the year, such as more moisture/wetness, so that certain types of diseases have a higher chance of onset. If we have fully understanding of the pattern, we should be able to figure out drugs that get better results. In other words, if we can figure out what are the climatic factors that have supportive effect on Covid-19, we can probably get some clue from the opposite of that factor for curing the virus.

If you find above hard to understand, here's the simple logic:

1. Whether it is human, animals, plants or virus, everything in the world is part of the nature and carries one or more characteristics of the nature.
2. Ancient Chinese has summarised these natural characteristics as wind, fire, heat, moisture, dryness and cold.
3. Different things carry different characteristics, also, the characteristics of a particular thing can change over time.
4. Different characteristics restrict each other, e.g. cold vs fire/heat, moisture vs dryness.
5. Ancient Chinese have figured out the rule of how and how much these characteristics based on different time (ie. sexagenary cycle).

Since virus also exists in the nature, if we can find what characteristics it carries, we should be able to defeat it using the opposite of that characteristic. Note, here I'm not talking about the origin of the virus, which is a much bigger topic out of the scope of this article.

To live a healthy life, we strive for a balance between these characteristics. Many of these terminologies may sound like superstition, but if we think about it, it's actually not hard to find equivalents in modern medicine science: we sometimes describe pain as "inflammation" - the word itself closely resembles what ancient Chinese described as "fire"; We say "catch a cold", which is similar (although not exactly the same) to the characteristic "cold".

## A Possible Cure

SARS-CoV, a virus that was first identified in late 2002 / early 2003, belongs to the same coronavirus family as COVID-19, it's interesting if we compare the time when they started, based on sexagenary cycle system:

| Desease | G.Start             | S.Start               | Element | Influence      |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------|----------------|
| SARS    | Nov 2002 - Feb 2003 | I7 (壬午) - J8 (癸未)  | Fire    | Cold, Moisture |
| COVID_19| Late 2019           | F12 (己亥) - G1 (庚子) | 

From table 

According to the Fact Sheet from Centers of Disease Control and Prevention of US, "SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003", its symptoms include high fever, headache, body aches and an overall feeling of discomfort. Converting 2003 Georgian to Sexagenary Cycle we get J8 (癸未年), whose element is Water, and 



Ancient Chinese also found five flavours of food each have their own characterstics and function (I gave each of them an abbreviation, to use in the calculation later):

- Sour (SUR)
- Sweet (SWT)
- Bitter (BTR)
- Spicy (SPC)
- Salt (SLT)

Each of the flavours could benefit an organ while has disadvantage for another organ, if you ever went to any Asian (mostly Chinese) massage business, you might have seen this picture:



It illustrates the relations between human organs in term of Five Elements:

| Organ | Element | Good for the Organ | Bad for the Organ |
| ------| ------- | ------------------:| -----------------:|
| Kidney | Water | Salt | Sweet |
| Lung | Metal | Spicy | Bitter |
| Spleen | Earth | Sweet | Sour |
| Heart | Fire | Bitter | Salt |
| Liver | Wood | Sour | Spicy |

How does it work? For example, we believe that children would get bad teeth if they eat lots of sweets without properly clean their teeth, due to sugar attracts bacteria and lowers mouth’s pH scale (a measure of how acidic a solution is), when the pH of plaque drops below normal, the acidity would start to dissolve minerals and destroy the tooth’s enamel. However, the theory of Chinese medication is that, even if the kid properly cleans the teeth after eating sweets, he/she could still get bad teeth. Based on the picture above showing the relation of Five Elements and internal organs, sweet benefits spleen, which is “Earth”, and “Earth” overcomes “Water” which is the attribute of “Kidney”, and Chinese medication believes teeth (as well as nails, hair) are grown as a result of the “Qi” from kidney (I’ll explain later what Qi is). It’s not a surprise that western scientists also realised the connection between kidney and oral health, such like a study in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology reported that people with kidney disease and those on dialysis are more likely to have periodontal disease and other oral health problems than the general population.

Sounds complex? Not really, you only need to understand the concept of Five Elements and their relation with Five Flavours and internal organs, to figure out what could possibly be the problem when one feels sick. And remember that in order to have good health one should maintain a balance in term of Five Elements within our body. Even under the rule of western life science, we also strive for balance - balance of various types of vitamins that body need, through different types of vegetal, diary products, meat, fish, etc, and we all know that lack of diversity in food consumption could lead to different types of illness.

Easy? Not quite, because there are other factors apart from human body itself, that could lead to human body unbalanced in term of Five Elements, so now let’s look at the Sexagenary Cycle.
