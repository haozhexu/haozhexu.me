      <title>If life is always like first seeing - Adelaide (4) The Wine Is Strong</title>

      <description>(4) The Wine Is Strong Penfold winery isn&amp;rsquo;t far from Adelaide city, the day was cloudy when we visited it, not a good day for taking selfies for tourists - I don&amp;rsquo;t usually take photos of landscape, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter too much to me. I brought GX85 with 12-35mm lens for convenience. When we arrived at Penfold, its signature red immediately attracted my eyes.
There wasn&amp;rsquo;t too many people in the winery, and the layout of buildings here is special, not sure how it was designed when it was built.</description>

      <title>If life is always like first seeing - Adelaide (3) Slow City, Flying Life</title>

      <description>(3) Slow City, Flying Life  Time doesn&amp;rsquo;t fly, life does.
 When we arrived at Adelaide city, it&amp;rsquo;s almost dark. We lived in a hotel opposite to the University of Adelaide. It&amp;rsquo;s not far from CBD, on the back there&amp;rsquo;s a street full of retailers.
I went out to the street with X-Pro2 and 35mm f2 lens, I&amp;rsquo;ve read people saying 50mm equivalent focal length is too narrow for today&amp;rsquo;s street, I think the key is to keep in mind what your lens could see, and look for things that can be framed, regardless of whether the street is narrow or wide.</description>

      <title>If life is always like first seeing - Adelaide (2) Street on Island</title>

      <description>(2) Street on Island Kangaroo Island Kangaroo Island isn&amp;rsquo;t far from Adelaide, famous for its large number of scenery - actually I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether it&amp;rsquo;s famous or not, the only reason I said so, is because there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any ferry ticket available several weeks before we travel, so we had no choice but had to go with a tourist group. I guess they bought lots of tickets long time ago, in order to take their customers onto the island.</description>

      <title>If life is always like first seeing - Adelaide (1) Lighthouse</title>

      <description>In my mind there are three types of travel, the first type is to travel with tourist group, visiting routine places and stay at each place for enough time to take photos (mostly selfies); The second type is more casual and relax, you have your own plan of where to visit and stay, how much time to be spent at each place; The last type isn&amp;rsquo;t just physically going to somewhere, it&amp;rsquo;s more about how one&amp;rsquo;s spirit evolve, like reading a book.</description>

      <description>Rediscover the Wonderful World with Pseudo-Science Prologue I was on the flight back to China, the air conditioner made me feel sick, it was a bit too cold. I tried to focus on something that could distract me from the sickness, then I noticed the small round window next to me, it reminded me of the windows in the classroom of my elementary school — they have wooden frames painted in green and are always clean.</description>

      <description>Photo taken by a colleague at lunch time, I was using a piece of tissue to cover my face since I’m a shy guy who never wants to be in photos. Until I looked at the photo I didn’t realise that I wasn’t even in focus. Lesson learned from this: one’s not as important as he/she thought in other people’s eyes.
My name is Haozhe XU and I’m an iOS software developer currently based in Melbourne, Australia.</description>
