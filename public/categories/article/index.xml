      <description>A Concise Method of Lottery Prediction  Q: The balls are randomly picked, how could you predict?
A: If so, why don&amp;rsquo;t people usually buy number combinations like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?
Q: That does not look random at all!
 In fact, the chance that the next lottery winning numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, is exactly the same as every other combination of numbers, but still, people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t usually buy number combinations which look like following certain pattern, and this is precisely how the algorithm works for prediting future winning numbers.</description>

      <description>Best Fuji Lens for Street Photography - 24mm F8 Body Cap Review Human are always contradictory: we say we&amp;rsquo;d like to save the environment, while we generate lots of waste each day; We say we&amp;rsquo;d like to be healthy, while living in a unhealthy way of eating and working; We say we&amp;rsquo;d like to have a young heart, while becoming more and more realistic in a materialistic world…even when I escaped to the lonely island of street photography, there is also a contradiction: photographers say street photography is all about content while arguing about the image quality of gears.</description>

With cup in hand, I ask of the blue sky,
&amp;ldquo;I do not know in the celestial sphere
What name this festive night goes by?&amp;rdquo;
Su Shi, Chinese Poem
 I once had a long dream, in the dream I was invited to a meeting and the meeting took place inside the Pyramid.</description>

      <description>Rediscover the Wonderful World with Metaphysics Prologue Every year I fly back to China to visit my relatives, many years ago, when I was on the plane back to China, the air conditioning was bit too aggressive which made me uncomfortable, I tried to find something to divert my attention and then noticed the small round window next to me, it reminds me of the windows in the classroom of my elementary school, with green wooden window frame.</description>

Melbourne&amp;rsquo;s weather is very inconsistent, it was sunny midday, and now is pouring rain. I went into the library to make sure the camera still works when I return it. The huge amount of books in the library remind me of a quiz that I heard long time ago:</description>

      <description>100 Years in One Day - Leica M10-P Review (3) The Color Previous: 100 Years in One Day - Leica M10-P Review (2) The Street
The first thing Leica feels to some people is a nostalgia feeling - it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to understand that Leica always reminds people of the history of photography; Usually, the second thing comes to people&amp;rsquo;s mind is its color signature. In film age, color mainly depends on film, whereas in digital age it would largely depends on the combination of sensor and firmware that converts sensor output to actual image file.</description>

I could only use the M10-P for the weekend, unfortunately the weather was bad most of the time and I was afraid of using it even in light rain, I first thought this was because I have to return the camera to get my deposit back, but soon I realised even if it&amp;rsquo;s my own camera, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to risk it in rain consider how much it costs.</description>

      <description>100 Years in One Day - Leica M10-P Review (1) First Seeing Recently Leica has some event that lets people try M10 for a day, I booked and when I arrived at the shop, the staff told me the person who borrowed M10 the day before had not returned it yet, instead I was offered an M10-P, which was a newer model that Leica just released.
It was the first time for me to use a Leica M, also the first time using a range finder.</description>

      <description>Lumix GX9 - Dedication to Street Photography  “For me, photography is not a means by which to create beautiful art, but a unique way of encountering genuine reality.” - Daido Moriyama
 My first mirrorless camera was a Panasonic Lumix GX7 which I bought more than three years ago, at that time I did not know anything about photography. When I was deciding which camera to buy, I only saw three facts: Mirrorless cameras from Panasonic and Olympus can share lens, there was a large number of lens to choose from, and, they were relatively cheaper compared to the ones from other systems.</description>
