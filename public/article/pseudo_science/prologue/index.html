<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>

<p>I was on the flight back to China, the air conditioner made me feel sick, it was a bit too cold. I tried to focus on something that could distract me from the sickness, then I noticed the small round window next to me, it reminded me of the windows in the classroom of my elementary school — they have wooden frames painted in green and are always clean.</p>

<p>When I finished kindergarten and started elementary school, my uncle bought me a trilogy of books, called “Discover a Wonderful World”, the books have a storyline of three cartoon characters travelling around the world, visiting different places and discovering different cultures, scenes, architectures on their way, including the Egyptian Pyramid, Bermuda Triangle, Maya and so on, there seems to be a lot of things created in history that human could not understand or explain, I was very much into them. Curiosity is a good teacher that drives me to study hard with a hope of finding the answers of the unknowns, but it didn’t work. Science related subjects, physics, mathematics, chemistry, even computer science I studied at Melbourne University, none of them gave me the answer to those unknowns. Of course, school education largely increased my knowledge base and provided me the skills to survive in a modern society.</p>

<p>At the time when I was writing these piece of text, it’s been five years since I graduated from university. Recalling my life as a student, apart from the knowledge I learned, the most remarkable thing I could clearly remember is just the green-framed windows in my elementary school. Learning could be boring, especially when the motivation of study is to explain the unknowns but nothing could be explained. However, through the daily-cleaned windows, I saw a different world: leaves of tall trees touching the windows, people yielding and selling goods off the streets and people walking in a hurry. They let me feel the sense of life, and the scene was never repetitive. Throughout the year, people wear different clothes in different seasons; Even on the same day, I could see different kinds of people: innocent children laughing and playing, young people are always busy and working hard for their living and elders walking around at a slower pace. These often remind me of the Four States of Phenomena in the Principle of Physics (as described in Buddhism scripture): formation, existence, destruction, and emptiness.</p>

<p>With the advancement of science, while people all enjoy the convenience provided by new technologies, at the same time we are also facing more and more troubles: wars, natural disasters, environmental pollution, resources shortage, or the ethnic conflict and discord between as large as nations and as small as friends and families. It seems that the way human is walking on is getting narrower, but we expect science to be the only solution for all these problems, specifically, we largely do not know any other solutions that can be better than science, which leads and predominates the way human discover the world. The fact is, besides modern science, there are other cognitive structures, which can be used to learn and explain the universe, but due to the predominance of modern science which people heavily rely on for the purpose of corporeal enjoyment in a material world, many people do not want to touch, accept, or even don’t know there is a completely different scientific system, which, as a guiding ideology in ancient China and many other colonies in the past, created wonderful civilisations whose technologies and creations can not be explained by modern science. People call it metaphysics, also called as pseudo-science.</p>

<p>So what is metaphysics? This text was originally written in Chinese and later translated to English, when I looked in the dictionary, I found two translations of the Chinese word of “metaphysics”: “metaphysics” and the other is “pseudo-science”. Emotionally I tend to prefer the former, since ‘pseudo’ more or less implies cheating and lying, but ‘pseudo-science’ was chosen for the title of the book, this is on purpose: it doesn’t only emphasise the things discussed here are beyond science (more specifically, modern science), but it is also a satire on modern science that most people are pretty much into.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don’t let your boy’s schooling interfere with his education.
— Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A while ago I read a story: given a certain amount of fencing timber, what you need to do is to fence an area that you can claim ownership of the land inside; The question is, how do you shape your fence so you get the largest possible area of land. A financier then used only a small amount of timber to fence himself, then declared he was outside of the fence. Despite the intended meaning of the story, I read it as the person is trying to be smart but his greediness and desire have put himself in a narrow space, in which his vision is limited. This narrow space is called modern science. I’m trying to break the fence, and see what is the world outside.</p>

<p>Some of my classmates stayed in university after graduation and did some further study, a few of them were doing Ph.D. One of them is a Christian, he went to church every weekend. I told him I was about to write down all my findings related to the world and the universe, he was very interested and asked me in an academic accent that what kind of articles and papers I would reference, I told him the things I referenced include Buddhism scripture, Bible, Chinese mythology books, the scene appeared in my brain during meditation, rumours on the internet, youtube videos and some dreams I had when I sleep. His face looked like when the first time I ate sliced bread with Vegemite (although at that time I didn’t look at myself in a mirror), and yielded at me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh my God, are you OK? Referencing Bible? You will fail your thesis in science faculty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the problem here? He was a Christian, sighed to his God, then questioned Bible as a trustable source. In the class of world history in my secondary school, the teacher told us that if one believes in God, he/she could be saved. I don’t know if my friend can be saved since I’m not sure whether he really believes in God, even though he goes to church every week. I fully understand his concern from an academic point of view, and just because of this, I deeply feel the fact that human nowadays rely heavily on modern science has sealed up our vision. If what modern science found so far are considered as universal truth, there is no way for people to value different cognitive systems other than modern science. <strong>Only if human can change their rigid way of thinking, mankind will make a leap forward towards discovering the truth of life, time, space, and universe.</strong> I quite like the quote from the movie “2012”, when Nima seeks help from Lama Rinpoche for his confusion, Lama then tries to add water to a cup which is already full (so the water flows out), and said:
Like this cup, you are full of opinions and speculations. To see the light of wisdom, you first must empty your cup.</p>

<p>As far as I can see, science and metaphysics are not contradicting, they are just different views of life, time, space and universe. Modern science has its convenience that everyone can learn some knowledge in order to improve the quality of their lives in a material world — isn’t living a better life good enough? Who’d need to care whether the knowledge is really the truth?</p>

<p>I read a book called Sophie’s World (by Jostein Gaarder), the book describes the world as a giant rabbit, everyone lives on the surface of its skin, people believe the skin is the whole world; Most of them keep digging into the skin, that’s where material benefit resides, they believe this is the way of life because the skin is the only thing their eyes could see and their hands could touch. Sometimes, they raise up their heads but see a black sky which is a silent void, far away and unreachable, thus they don’t think too much about it since they don’t understand it — after all, they don’t have to understand it because it’s nothing to do with their lives: life is all about digging further into the rabbit’s skin, just like what we do.
There are a few philosophers, however, when looking at the sky, wondered what those shining spots are and eventually realized their “world” is merely a giant rabbit. They want to see the world outside (like I saw the outside world through the green-framed window in my elementary school), so they climb up to the top of the rabbit’s fur. Ordinary people see those philosophers as idiots because they don’t get any material benefit by doing that, and it’s also quite dangerous on top of the rabbit’s fur. Why do we care about something far away? What’s wrong with digging inside as long as people feel happy and desires are satisfied? It could be that those philosophers have a different understanding of happiness, but no matter how one understands it, no matter how one lives his/her life, one cannot escape from death, and always has to face the ultimate questions of human being (that those philosophers try to answer): where are we from, what are the final destination, who are we?</p>

<p>Let’s start with a dream I had, not long ago.</p>
