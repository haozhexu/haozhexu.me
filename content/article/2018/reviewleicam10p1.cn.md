# 一日百年 - 徕卡M10-P评测 (1) 初见

最近徕卡的一个活动让我有机会试用M10一天，到了预约的那天，一早来到店里，被告知昨天测试M10的人还没归还，因此给了我一部M10-P，是刚发布不久比M10更新的型号。

这是我第一次用徕卡M相机，也是第一次用旁轴取景相机。徕卡这个牌子对我来说并不陌生，然而用惯了M43的微单和小定焦，把M10-P拿在手里那一刻，还是被它的重量给震惊了 —— 它比看起来重多了。仔细检查了相机的各个部件（其实徕卡的简约设计也没什么好检查的）后，对重量的感觉不那么明显了，而逐渐的被它的做工品质吸引 —— 一个很久不见的品质。

小时候家里的很多物件都给我质量很好的感觉，因为它们都有很长的使用历史：奶奶的蝴蝶牌缝纫机用了十年多还一直在用，爷爷的收音机用了许多年还没有坏，父亲自从工作后就一直骑的永久自行车……这些东西有的需要定期维护，常见的比如上油，总体来说它们都能用很长时间。长大之后这些东西都不用了，人们在一个
When I was a kid, many of the items at home were of high quality based on their lifespan: grandmother’s sewing machine that had been used for ten years, grandfathers radio receiver which lasted for ages, father had a bicycle since he started his job which still works…some of them requires regular maintenance like oiling, but they generally last. After I grown up, things changed rapidly, materials are abundant and people's expectation for quality became lower than before, most things are mass produced and cheap enough that getting a new one isn’t much more expensive than fixing and maintain old ones - why fixing it if you can get brand new one at similar cost?

Then there’s a company who has more than 100 years’ history, still values top quality and craftsmanship, refuses to be a mass product manufacturer and does not try to catch up with anyone but stays with its own tradition, who is often criticised for over-charging and considered as a luxury attachment rather than a photography equipment, whose signature is a red dot.

I’m fully aware that a digital camera will become outdated when internal electronic wears out and technology gets old, I also think it could be cheaper to get more people in the Leica world. What I enjoyed though, is the quality and craftsmanship that remained for more than 100 years, in this regard, once you hold an M in hand, you’ll realised how camera should be built and how things should work. Some people say that each Leica M has a soul, I kind of agree if it means each camera has to go through a series of manual procedures before it can be shipped, however, regarding soul, I have some different theory learned from Chinese classics.

![Signature][M10P-4]

In Chinese classics, it is believed that any item can gain a soul after being used for enough timespan with a specific purpose. For example, mirrors are mainly used to adjust things related to one’s appearance before one leaves home; Rulers are used to make sure sizes and dimensions are measured correctly. Both of them have the function of “correcting things”, and over a long period of usage time, they accumulate the character of "correction", which then become their soul. That’s why in some Asian countries people like hanging old brass mirror or old tailor’s ruler somewhere on the wall, in order to get rid of evils (ie. negative energy in the household).

![Lens][M10P-5]

The lens mounted on M10-P is the 50mm f/2.5 Summarit, without auto focusing motor, it is even smaller than many M43 primes, actually the Summilux f/1.4 isn't big either. M lenses have aperture ring and distance scale marked, the lens shell is mostly more flush compared to AF lenses from other systems which makes the whole system looking slim.

![Auto][M10P-6]

People say that digital Leica doesn't hold value over time compared to film ones, this is probably true, but keep in mind, there are still film Leica M produced and sold, so I see it as a compromise, or balance, between tradition and modern: not everyone wants to spend effort shooting and developing films, but at the same time people do not want to lose the connection from modern to tradition, they still prefer the build quality and the way camera works that they enjoyed when they were young, or when their parents were young, that nostalgic feelinig which cannot be described by specs and technology, thus the existance of digital Ms, just like the A mode on a manual control camera, which is the same red as the brand dot.
