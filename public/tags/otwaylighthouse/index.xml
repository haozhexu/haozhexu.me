      <description>In my mind there are three types of travel, the first type is to travel with tourist group, visiting routine places and stay at each place for enough time to take photos (mostly selfies); The second type is more casual and relax, you have your own plan of where to visit and stay, how much time to be spent at each place; The last type isn&amp;rsquo;t just physically going to somewhere, it&amp;rsquo;s more about how one&amp;rsquo;s spirit evolve, like reading a book.</description>
