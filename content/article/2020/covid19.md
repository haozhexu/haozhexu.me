Since the end of 2019, the new coronavirus has caused panic around the world. The number of infections and deaths has been on the rise. The economies of various countries have suffered huge blows, and we currently do not have a specific medicine or vaccine, not to mention the currently known virus mutations cast a shadow over vaccine development based on gene sequence. In fact, viruses have always coexisted with humans on the earth. Before the beginning of modern virology, people of different cultures had their own ways to fight against diseases for thousands of years. Is there some knowledge that we can learn from and get inspiration for the purpose of treating the virus?

It brings to my attention that ancient China had a system that were used to predict virus caused by pathegenic climate change, based on which ancient Chinese has built up theories of how a person can improve his/her body system to prevent virus invation, and there are evidences that the ancient view aligns well with modern medicine science. To understand the system, it's necessary to first understand how the ancient Chinese measure _time_.

Let's have a look at how we measure time in the modern age:

> A year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by change in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked.
> -- Wikipedia

The idea of "time" isn't unfamiliar to us if we look at the description above, however, not many people (including Chinese nowadays) know that ancient Chinese had a time system which was used as a guidence for human activities, from weather prediction to individual's wellbeing, from agriculture to the change of regime. The foundation of this system is the Five Elements Theory and the Stems and Branches Cycle, these two concepts are the keys to study the virus in the ancient way.

## Five Elements Theory

The system of Five Elements consists of five conceptual scheme: Fire, Water, Wood, Metal and Earth, they are the fundamental elements of the material world that ancient Chinese believed, similar to the elemental periodic table we learnt in school.

The common nature of chemical elements and the Five Elements is that they all have certain ways of transformation: chemical reactions encompass changes that involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, whereas the Five Elements form a “mutual generating” cycle and a "mutual overcoming" cycle:

| Element | Generate | Overcome |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Metal   | Water    | Wood     |
| Wood    | Fire     | Earth    |
| Water   | Wood     | Fire     |
| Fire    | Earth    | Metal    |
| Earth   | Metal    | Water    |

_(table 1)_

The diagram below gives you a more intuitive view:

TODO: diagram

The transformation above is based on the people's observation of the world. For example, let's imagine such a scene: after a rain the soil absorbs all the rain water, when the sun comes out the plants start to grow, this phenomenon implies Earth overcomes Water as well as Water generates Wood; Yet another example: we use water to put out a fire while the fire burns all the crops into ashes, this phenomenon implies Water overcomes Fire and Fire generates Earth. Of course the quantity of each element also plays an important role, suppose we try to put out a big bushfire with a bowl of water, it won't work and probably will make it even worse. From a chemical perspective we could explain this as each of the water molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, when put on fire, they split and form separate hydrogen and oxygen, both would aggravate the fire.

Due to the abstraction of the Five Elements, it is also used to describe interactions and relations of a wide range of phenomena. For example, internal organs, you may have seen the graph below in Asian massage businesses:

TODO: Five elements and organs

In term of climate, the Five Elements Theory could provide guidence of weather and climate change, to a level of detail that can be used to determine how the environment could influence the health of human. The whole system is very complex, involving another two theories: Sexagenary Cycle and Climatic Vital Energy (a.k.a Five Movement and Six Qi).

On Wikipedia it states:

> The sexagenary cycle, also known as the Stems-and-Branches or ganzhi, is a cycle of sixty terms, each corresponding to one year, thus a total of sixty years for one cycle, historically used for reckoning time in China and the rest of the East Asian cultural sphere.

If the Sexagenary Cycle is an ancient calendar system for measuring time, then Climatic Vital Energy is the ancient "seasons" on top of their time system. How does it differ from the four seasons we know nowadays? We know that (in many places on the planet) summer is hot, winter is cold and autumn is cool, but have you ever noticed that winter in some years are colder than the winter in other years? Summer comes earlier in certain years but later in other years? Sometimes summer has less rain which leads to drought but sometimes it can have quite a lot of water that leads to flood? In fact, the climate of each year is unique in many ways that cannot be simply described by four seasons, the climate system used by ancient Chinese is based on the Five Elements theory extensively, it describes the sublte difference of each year, this system co-exists with their calendar, the Sexagenary Cycle.

I won't dive into the details of Sexagenary Cycle, Vital Energy or Five Movement and Six Qi, if you are interested, Google should find you a lot of materials on these topics. As a minimum requirement, I'll briefly talk about how the Sexagenary Cycle works in collaboration with the ancient seasons.

The Sexagenary Cycle consists of two sets of symbols, one set has ten ordinals called the ten heavenly stems, and another set of twelve symbols called the earthly branches, which are based on orbit of Jupiter whose celestial circle was divided into twelve sections. The first term jiǎzǐ (甲子) combines the first heavenly stem with the first earthly branch; The second term yǐchǒu (乙丑) combines the second stem with the second branch. This pattern continues until both cycles conclude simultaneously with guǐhài (癸亥), after which it begins again at jiǎzǐ (A1). Each combination resembles a year.

The ancient season system works as follows, for each year in the Sexagenary Cycle:

1. The year has a year-wise elemental effect which is one of the Five Elements.
2. The year has a primary set of seasons, in the order of wood, fire, earth, metal, water; The order and elements echo the seasons we know nowadays: spring (warm) - wood, summer (hot/dry) - fire, summer (wet) - earth, autumn (cool) - metal, winter (cold) - water.
3. The year has a secondary set of seasons, running on top of the primary set, differs from year to year.
4. Each year has six _primary climatic influences_ in the order of wind, fire, heat, moisture, dryness and cold. The order stays the same every year, overlapping with seasons: spring - wood - wind, summar - earth - fire/heat/moisture, autumn - metal - dryness, winter - water - cold.
5. Each year has six _secondary climatic influences_, also consists of wind, fire, heat, moisture, dryness and cold, but varies from year to year. This is a more detailed climatic feature, it explains why some years have colder winters, some years have hotter summer, in some years winter comes ealier or later, etc.

The ancients believed that changes in nature, such as plant growth, flowering, fruiting, migratory birds, snow, thunder, river freezing, etc, all reflect the process of the transformation of Five Elements, which then manifest in reality one or several climatic characteristics (wind, fire, heat, moisture, dryness and cold) that would influence human body, these characteristics are often called as "six climatic influence". Modern science also agrees that weather or climate can influence human body which more or less aligns with the traditional thinking that the atmosphere has effect on people's health. For us to understand, we only need to know that both modern and traditional thinking believe that extreme weather or climate can do harm (ie. influence human body): if the climate is normal, the "six influences" in human body is also balanced; When the climate is abnormal, the balance in the body is also disordered.

The unbalance of the "six climatic influences" can affect the incidence of diseases and the prognosis of transmission, due to the disease is biased to a certain pathogenesis in the year, such as more moisture/wetness, so that certain types of diseases have a higher chance of onset. Using the rule of how "six climatic influences" occur in each sexagenary year, we can infer the occurrence of diseases and take preventive measures early. So here's the logic:

1. Ancient Chinese has summarised six climatic influences of nature: wind, fire, heat, moisture, dryness and cold.
2. Since everything in the world is part of the nature, everything carries one or more of these influences, no matter it is human, animal or plants.
3. The weight of each influence in a particular body is different, and it can also change over time.
4. Different influences restrict each other, e.g. cold vs fire/heat, moisture vs dryness.

In simple words, if we can figure out what are the climatic influences that have supportive effect on Covid-19, we can probably get some clue from the opposite of that influence for curing the virus. Note, here I'm not talking about the origin of the virus, which is a much bigger topic out of the scope of this article.

The ancient way to live a healthy life is to strive for a balance between those influences in human body via food and daily activities. Many of the terminologies mentioned so far may sound like superstition, but they actually exist in our everyday life that we may not be aware of. You may have heard that ginger are warm in nature (which corresponds to the "heat" influence mentioned before), it's good for people who have excessive "cold" in body; If you have ever ate at Asian restaurants, braised fish or pork dishes usually have not only ginger, but also star-anise (aniseed) in it, that's because fish and pork have the nature of "cold", especially fish who live in water thus also carry the influence of "dampness", both of these can be balanced by a combination of ginger and aniseed where ginger is warm and aniseed as an _aromatic plant_ can get rid of the dampness; Cinnamon is widely used in different types of food and drinks, also carries the "warm" influence, western medicine science found its value in treating digestive insufficiency, a study suggested that therapeutic concentrations of cinnamon can be used to treat age-related inflammation, particularly in the joints[1]; Western medical providers are increasingly using this spice to treat high blood glucose[2], the ancient explanation is that its "warm" factor balances the "cold" in human's digesting system.

You may wonder, isn't this all about Chinese medicine? Not exactly, we are not talking about Western or Chinese medicine, but rather focusing on a broader categorisation of natural influences for the sake of studying Covid-19. For instance, the "cold" influence isn't a speicifc term of either Chinese medicine or western medicine, it's a physical attribute of the world we are living in. From a physical point of view, "cold" makes fluids more viscous, so cold is considered to be the main cause of poor or obstructed circulation. Reflecting on human, people with cardiovascular diseases have a high chance of feeling uncomfortable in winter. Since many diseases are related to "cold", this factor was highly regarded in ancient times. People with excessive "cold" show pale complexion, cold hands and feet, chills and fear of cold, as well as body weakness; while those with excessive "heat" may manifest themselves as dry eyes, dry mouth, constipation, tinnitus, etc.

People often say "you are what you eat", if we want to balance the influences in our body via food, how do we know what food has which kind of influence? For plants, during its life time, if it need relatively more water and less sunlight, it's likely to be towards "cold"; On the other hand, if a plant can grow well with little water but requires lots of sunlight, its characteristic will likely to be "warm". For a particular plant, different parts may have different weights of influences, for instance, cinnamon usually refers to the dried bark of Cinnamomom Cassia, whose characteristic may be different from the leaves of the tree.

The influences carried by animals are determined by their _activeness_, and for obvious reason, animals in water usually carry the influence of dampness. Beef is relatively more warm than pork, lamb is wamer than beef, birds are even warmer. The same animal can carry different influence based on their activity, for example, wild chickens (ie. pheasant) are much more warmer than captive chickens.

With the theory of all above, now let's look at a few deseases in history and what charactereis or influences they have.

## Possible Cures

SARS-CoV, a virus that was first identified in late 2002 / early 2003, belongs to the same coronavirus family as COVID-19 (ie. SARS-CoV-2), the table below shows the time when they first started and the climatic influence based on sexagenary cycle:

| Disease 	| Georgian 	| Sexagenary Year Span 	| Y.W.I | Start P.I. 	| Start S.I. 	| Next P.I. 	| Next S.I 	|
|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|-	|- |
| SARS 	| Nov 2002 - Feb 2003 	| 壬午 - 癸未 	| Wood/Fire   | 太阳寒水 Water/Cold 	| 阳明燥金 Metal/Dryness 	| 厥阴风木 Wood/Wind 	| 太阴湿土 Earth/Dampness 	|
| Covid-19 	| Late 2019 - Now 	| 己亥 - 庚子 	| Earth/Metal | 太阳寒水 Water/Cold 	| 厥阴风木 Wood/Wind 	| 厥阴风木 Wood/Wind 	| 少阴君火/阳明燥金 Fire/Metal/Dryness 	|

Y.W.I - Year Wise Influence
P.I. - Primary Influence
S.I. - Secondary Influence

(don't worry if you don't understand the years in Sexagenary Cycle - you can consider them as symbols representing different years in a different calendar)

We can ignore Primary Influence, for the sake of this article, we can consider them as our regular seasons, so Water/Cold and Wood/Wind are simply winter and spring. Note, this is based on Northern Hemisphere. What we are interested in are the secondary influences. Based on the climatic influences we can make conclusions below, and keep in mind, these conclusions could be made even before the time, since the rule of climatic influences is "baked in" the sexagenary cycle:

- the Heavenly Stem of 2003 is fire, according to the mutual overcoming pattern of Five Elements, fire overcomes metal, and metal maps to lung, the manifestation is that the virus directly attacks lung.
- the end of 2019 has primary influence of water/cold, that is, winter; But the secondary influence at the same time was fire/heat, which translates to a warm winter, it created a supportive environment for virus.
