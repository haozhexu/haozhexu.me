      <description>Lumix GX9 - Dedication to Street Photography  “For me, photography is not a means by which to create beautiful art, but a unique way of encountering genuine reality.” - Daido Moriyama
 My first mirrorless camera was a Panasonic Lumix GX7 which I bought more than three years ago, at that time I did not know anything about photography. When I was deciding which camera to buy, I only saw three facts: Mirrorless cameras from Panasonic and Olympus can share lens, there was a large number of lens to choose from, and, they were relatively cheaper compared to the ones from other systems.</description>

      <description>(3) Slow City, Flying Life  Time doesn&amp;rsquo;t fly, life does.
 When we arrived at Adelaide city, it&amp;rsquo;s almost dark. We lived in a hotel opposite to the University of Adelaide. It&amp;rsquo;s not far from CBD, on the back there&amp;rsquo;s a street full of retailers.
I went out to the street with X-Pro2 and 35mm f2 lens, I&amp;rsquo;ve read people saying 50mm equivalent focal length is too narrow for today&amp;rsquo;s street, I think the key is to keep in mind what your lens could see, and look for things that can be framed, regardless of whether the street is narrow or wide.</description>

      <description>(2) Street on Island Kangaroo Island Kangaroo Island isn&amp;rsquo;t far from Adelaide, famous for its large number of scenery - actually I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether it&amp;rsquo;s famous or not, the only reason I said so, is because there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any ferry ticket available several weeks before we travel, so we had no choice but had to go with a tourist group. I guess they bought lots of tickets long time ago, in order to take their customers onto the island.</description>
