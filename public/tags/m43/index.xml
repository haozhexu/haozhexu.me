      <description>(4) The Wine Is Strong Penfold winery isn&amp;rsquo;t far from Adelaide city, the day was cloudy when we visited it, not a good day for taking selfies for tourists - I don&amp;rsquo;t usually take photos of landscape, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter too much to me. I brought GX85 with 12-35mm lens for convenience. When we arrived at Penfold, its signature red immediately attracted my eyes.
There wasn&amp;rsquo;t too many people in the winery, and the layout of buildings here is special, not sure how it was designed when it was built.</description>

      <description>In my mind there are three types of travel, the first type is to travel with tourist group, visiting routine places and stay at each place for enough time to take photos (mostly selfies); The second type is more casual and relax, you have your own plan of where to visit and stay, how much time to be spent at each place; The last type isn&amp;rsquo;t just physically going to somewhere, it&amp;rsquo;s more about how one&amp;rsquo;s spirit evolve, like reading a book.</description>
