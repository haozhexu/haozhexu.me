      <description>(4) The Wine Is Strong Penfold winery isn&#39;t far from Adelaide city, the day was cloudy when we visited it, not a good day for taking selfies for tourists - I don&#39;t usually take photos of landscape, so it doesn&#39;t matter too much to me. I brought GX85 with 12-35mm lens for convenience. When we arrived at Penfold, its signature red immediately attracted my eyes.
There wasn&#39;t too many people in the winery, and the layout of buildings here is special, not sure how it was designed when it was built.</description>
